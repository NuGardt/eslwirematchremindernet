 Author: Kevin 'OomJan' Gardthausen
 Last Update: 17.01.2012

 The match reminder is a plugin for ESL Wire (http://www.esl.eu/wire).

 This plugin lets your manage reminders for your upcoming matches. Never forget a match while you are actually sitting at your PC and forgetting the time while watching streams for instance.

 Notifications can be shown in game (through ESL Wire when supported), via a balloon popup on the taskbar and voice announcement (Text-To-Speech).

 Set multiple notifications before the scheduled start of match, set different options for each notification.
